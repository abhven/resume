% \lettersection{About Me}
Hi! I'm Deepa Bharadwaj, and it is with great enthusiasm that I apply for the role of UX Visual Designer at Fire TV, Amazon. I have been keenly following Amazon's design systems over the past few years, and one of my UX projects was the redesign of Amazon Prime Video's interface. I would love the opportunity to work on similar projects and contribute to your company's mission to redefine aesthetic standards and develop innovative solutions.

% \lettersection{Why Me?}
Having been designing and practicing architecture for over 3 years, I've learned the importance of leveraging empathy and a deep understanding of design systems to craft user-centered solutions. During the six month UXUI bootcamp at UC Berkeley, I enjoyed translating my experience designing for the built environment to choreographing digital experiences. My extensive user-centered design background has equipped me with a wide range of tools needed for visual storytelling \& effectively communicating product designs.



At UC Berkeley, my redesign for the \textbf{\href{http://bit.ly/primevideocasestudy}{Amazon Prime Video interface}} involved identifying and analyzing existing design problems, and leveraging existing UX patterns and assets to enhance the user experience. My competition entry for the \textbf{\href{http://bit.ly/barkcasestudy}{UX Hackathon 2020}} was among the top 10 finalists among 137 teams worldwide. Figma, Invision, Sketch, Keynote, Adobe Suite, 3D modeling softwares, etc. are a few of the design tools I'm extremely proficient in.I have also worked on front-end development in collaboration using HTML, CSS, Javascript and AnimeJS- my \textbf{\href{http://deepabharadwaj.com}{UX portfolio website }}which was coded from scratch being an example of the same. Working with front-end developers has taught me the importance of having a defined set of design specifications, to avoid the added time and hassle of development iterations.


My professional experience as an Architectural Designer includes working on buildings in Chicago, Oakland and Honolulu through the planning, design \& construction lifecycle. At CallisonRTKL, in addition to spearheading research for project data visualization, I set up an in-house 3D rendering team which proved to be twice as efficient and cut rendering costs by 75 \%. At my current design job, I'm working on designing a \$ 19 million high rise residential building in Oakland, which involves frequent design iterations based on constant communication with the client, as well as cross disciplinary collaboration with Engineers and Consultants to enable smooth and efficient construction of the project.
% \lettersection{Why Google?}
%I'd love to apply my expertise in design and experience in both architecture and product design to help build your product.
 
I'd love to apply my expertise in design and experience collaborating cross-functionally with multi-disciplinary teams to help improve Fire TV. As a UX Designer with a trans disciplinary background, I'm looking to leverage my architectural skills of problem solving, attention to detail \& my keen eye for elegant, modern design- and be a great addition to Amazon's fast-paced, growing studio in Sunnyvale.

In closing, I appreciate your consideration, and look forward to hearing from you and becoming a member of your team!
