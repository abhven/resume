\begin{cvletter}

% \lettersection{About Me}
It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of Applied Robotics Engineer, Everyday Robot Project at X. It would be a wonderful opportunity to be a part of a one of the best robotics team, building robots that make an impact on everyday life. Having worked in the autonomous vehicles industry as a Robotics Software Engineer for 2 years, in addition to 4 years of experience in Oil Field Services and automotive industries, I believe I would be a good fit for this position.

% \lettersection{Why Me?}
As you will see from my attached resume, I have experience writing production quality software for robot perception. At May Mobility, I have taken ownership of features, right from the conceptual stages and taken them to completion. Through the life cycle of the feature, I have improved the performance of the features by continuously fine tuning the algorithms, providing tools and diagnostics for operations and technical support teams.

Prior to May Mobility, I received my Master's degree in Robotics from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. At UM, my research was focused on vision for personal robots (Fetch, HSR). Additionally, I was the teaching assistant for two graduate level courses, Mathematics for Robotics and Advanced topics in computer vision, which covered various topics in Linear algebra and deep learning respectively. 

% \lettersection{Why Google?} 
I have been passionate about robots since my undergraduate program, and over a period of 11 years, I have worked on various parts, including perception software, embedded control, mechanical design and system integration. I find it exciting to use robots in various walks of life, and mission of Everyday Robot Project at X is an exact match. I believe that the technology developed at X would make a lasting impact on our society, and would love to contribute to it.
